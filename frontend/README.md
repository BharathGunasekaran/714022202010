# URL Shortener - Frontend (React + Material UI)

This is a minimal React frontend that talks to the backend at http://localhost:4000 by default.

Run (using a create-react-app or similar environment):
1. cd frontend
2. npm install
3. npm start

Notes:
- The UI uses Material UI components.
- The "Shorten" page allows up to 5 concurrent URL entries as required by the assessment.
- The "Statistics" page lists all shortened URLs and shows click details in a modal.
